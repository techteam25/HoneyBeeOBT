# HoneyBeeOBT
HoneyBee Oral Bible Translation tool

## Live demo available at https://zacpoorman.com/ (Heroku Costs Money, so we will probably be switching to netlify / zacpoorman.com)
This demo runs of of the OOCAZ fork, but should be updated every day, may make an automation or transfer to techteam deployment

Direction for HoneyBee development:
Those familiar with StoryPublisher will notice as they go through the concept design slides below, that HoneyBee and SPadv are very similar.  There are changes to be sure, especially on T&R and AC phases, but a vast majority of it is very similar.  So, we will be starting with the SPadv code as our base.  Also, we will be using the JSON template file, keeping as many of the tag names the same as possible.

The best template drafts, so far as being filled out the fullest, are the ones for Jonah.  They will be what we start with in designing a tool to create a database of templates and ultimately individual ZIP files that contain the required JSON, images & audio files to download to the phone app.  These Jonah templates are located at:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First clone the repo to your desired dev location locally:

``` git clone <url>```

Than make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed, look here:

https://nodejs.org/en/download

After this run this command inside of the cloned directory:

``` npx run install ```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Testing

New Changes! We are goign to be using Jest unit testing into the future. The E2E Cypress testing test refused to work well with out configuration so we will be removing Cypress ASAP.

To see example tests please look in the src/tests/ directory. 

To run tests ```npm run test``` and to see all of the potential console errors remove the --silent flag from your test command in package.json ( often not necessary unless the test is failing or note fully testing code)

At some point we will need to focues on unit testing and up our coverage, right now basic tests for all of the pages should be just fine.

## Tutorials

To gets started with Next (a flavor of React) with TypeScript feel free to look at the code base, ask questions and watch tutorials:

## Welcome to Next

Next is a flavor of React that has many advantages including a self hosted backend API structure. Most of our development will take place in Next using TypeScript (a type-safe form of JavaScript).

Upon some further investigation we will be connecting most forms of this software to remote servers to do alot of our processing so as not to burden the physical devices of the user. But upon having no internet we will rely upon the native devices to create and edit the media.

## Vulnerability scanning and patching
For the immediate need of harding web apps we will be using Snyk.io a scanner tool and vulnerability fixer for our needs. Has some good integration with github out of the box and is free to use.
