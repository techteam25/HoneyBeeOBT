God (via Joshua) led the new generation of Israel through the Jordan River to begin a new life obeying God in a new land. John dipped people in the waters of the Jordan River who were repenting from their sins and getting prepared for Kingdom life. Jesus went down into the waters of the Jordan River to be baptized by John and came out the other side to go into the wilderness for 40 days to show that he was re-playing Israel as the new Israel but doing it rightly, faithfully, in full obedience to God.

See Matthew 4:21–22; 10:2; 17:1–13; Mark 1:29; 3:17; 5:37; 9:1–13, 38; 10:35–41; 13:3; Luke 8:51; 9:28–36, 49, 54; 22:8; Acts 3:1–11; 4:13, 19–20; 8:14–17; Galatians 2:9; Revelation 1:1, 4, 9; 22:2, 8. (3) John Mark, the cousin of Barnabas and co-worker of Paul, wrote the Gospel of Mark (Acts 12:12; 13:4–13; 15:37–39; Colossians 4:10; 2 Timothy 4:11; Philemon 24; 1 Peter 5:13). (4) John was the name of the father of Simon Peter (Matthew 16:17; John 1:42; 21:15–17). (5) Also there was a member of the family of the High Priest Annas named John (Acts 4:6)."
